## **What you will do**

* Oversee and ensure the delivery of our projects:
    * It's a hand-on role so we expect you do code reviews with your squad members.
    * While full-time development is not part of the role, we expect and encourage you to take part in the development activities of your choosing to keep your skills in great shape.
    * Collaborate closely with the Product Manager and Team Leads to make sure our projects are delivered efficiently following our best practices.
    * Work closely with our Product Managers to guide our clients in their product development journey.

    * Collaborate closely with our Talent Team to improve our recruitment processes.
* Provide insights to and collaborate closely with the CTO to:
    * Improve the engineering skills of the team.
    * Coordinate activities between all engineering areas.

## **What challenges you will have**

* Given our growth, this is the first time we are hiring for such a role. So you will be given autonomy and real possibilities to support our company to grow.
* Maintain your technical expertise by being involved in development activities. The Engineering Lead role remains a 100% software engineering role with some management responsibilities. The role comes with reduced development activities but it's still an active "coding" role.
* Our team is composed of Thai and foreign nationals (> 8 nationalities). So you will have the opportunity to manage developers coming from various backgrounds, cultures, and countries.
* There is a lot of room for you to learn and grow in this role. We are open to new initiatives and processes to improve the way we operate.

## **Why you'll love working here**

* We are an **engineering-focused company**. Both co-founders are software engineers and led the tech teams at the most prominent e-commerce powerhouses in South East Asia.
* We really pay attention and care about **processes, high quality, and aesthetics**.
* **Strong processes**. We not only believe but also really work following agile principles. Developers work on well-sized and well-defined user stories, do estimate using points and work iteratively in short sprints (1-2 weeks).
* Regular one-on-one reviews to constantly **improve and grow**. We have a clearly defined process for our developers to level up continuously not only their technical skills but also soft skills.
* **The vast amount of learning resources** (Pluralsight, Pragpub, Leanpub, (e-)books, etc.) and yearly education allowance to step up your game.
* **[Nimble Growth](https://github.com/nimblehq/growth) session** to invest time in acquiring new skills, work on new technology to improve our process, and share the achievements.
* Provident Fund which allows you to save money every month and we match your monthly contributions ([see more detailed info](http://capital.sec.or.th/THAIPVD/content_en.php?content_id=00307)).
* Private medical insurance (Allianz) **from day one**, company care fund and social welfare coverage.

* Work from home policy and work from home allowance.
* Many more perks!

## **What you will bring**

* **5 years or more of professional web development experience**. Experience in Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript (Node.JS) or Go is preferred. If you have advanced experience in PHP or Python and want to step up your game learning another language or two, this is the right place for you.
* Prior experience as Engineering Lead/Engineering Manager/Tech Lead for teams of 5 or more is required.
* Prior experience in hiring software developers is required.
* Current active software development experience. We are looking for engineering managers who are still involved in development actively and want to continue doing so.

* A "Can do attitude" and a product mindset.
* Confidence in communicating in English.
* Willing to relocate to Bangkok, Thailand.
* Due to COVID-19 and international travel restriction, we are able to process candidates who are currently residing in Thailand only. If you are living outside of Thailand, we will get in touch with you once the travel ban is lifted.
